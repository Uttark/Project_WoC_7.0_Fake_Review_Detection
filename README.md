Amazon Review Detection : Genuine or Fake  (Web Scrapping and ML ) 
A.CHECKPOINT_1 :
  Extracting data from amazon product and converting to .csv file. 
  Cleaning the .csv file for training ML MODEL more accurately----> 
       Data Cleaning:
               Handling missing values by filling or removing incomplete data entries.
               Removing duplicates and irrelevant data (e.g., spam or unrelated reviews).
       Text Normalization:
               Converting all text to lowercase to maintain uniformity.

         Vectorization:
               Converting text data into numerical formats (e.g., TFIDF or word
