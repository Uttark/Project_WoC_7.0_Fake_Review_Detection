KBM,6 May 2024,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good looks at great price,"(1)  Amazon sent the product with a worst packing -- in just a very thin polythene cover.  (2)  But when I spread the Mouse Pad, surprisingly occupied almost the whole of the table space !!  (3)  Seems a smooth surface but do have most refined friction surface helping the movement of the Mouse efficiently.  (4) The borders on all the 4 corners are of so fine quality never hampers keeping hand over it.  (5)  Finally what I did, I cut the Mouse Pad into 2.  I bet you, even then you can never ever get such a large size Mouse Pad however much money you spend !!  I dare say this as I have come across dozens and dozens of Mouse Pads in around 3 decades.
